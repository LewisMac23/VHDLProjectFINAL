TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.845 ns between w_light/count_reg[6]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and w_light/count_reg[15]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.850 ns between w_light/count_reg[6]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and w_light/count_reg[14]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
